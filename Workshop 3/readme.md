# Workshop 3: Templates

In this workshop, you design and code several class templates and test them on different instantiations.



## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- design and code a class template
- template a class variable
- specialize a templated class variable for a particular type
- instantiate a template class
- specialize a member function of a templated class to process a particular type
- derive a templated class from another templated class




## Part 1 (0%)

This workshop consists of five modules:
- `w3` (supplied)
- `Set`
- `Pair`
- `SetSummable`
- `PairSummable`

The solution to Part 1 invokes the first three modules. 

Enclose all your source code within the `sdds` namespace and include the necessary guards in each header file.

All the modules **you create** in this workshop must have only a header file. *ðŸ—Ž Explain in the reflection why we do not split a module into `*.h` and `*.cpp` like you did in the previous workshops.*

In all classes that you create, you are allowed to add any **private** members that your design requires (without changing the specs)!



### `w3` Module (supplied)


**Do not modify this module!**  Look at the code and make sure you understand how to instantiate a templated class.



### `Set` Module

This module represents a family of collections of elements of any data type (for example, sets of `int`s, or sets of `Student`s, etc.).

Design and code a class template named `Set`. Your template manages a statically allocated array of any datatype. The template parameters in order of their specification are:

- `N`: the capacity of the collection (a non-type parameter; an integer without sign). This is the maximum number of elements that can be added to the collection
- `T`: the type of any element in the collection

Your design keeps track of the current number of elements stored in the collection (which may differ from the capacity of the collection (`N`)). Initially the collection has no elements.


**This module should not use or know the type `Pair`!!**



***Public Members***

- `size_t size() const`: returns the current number of elements in the collection
- `const T& get(size_t idx) const`: returns a reference to the element at index `idx` of the statically allocated array (assume that the parameter is valid).
- `void operator+=(const T& item)`: if the collection has capacity for another element, adds a copy of `item` to the collection. Otherwise, does nothing.


Add any other **private** members that your design requires (without changing the specs above)!



### `Pair` Module

This module represents a family of *value-key* pairs.

Design and code a class template named `Pair`. Your template manages a single *value-key* pair. The template parameters (in order) identify the type of the value and the type of the key that constitute a `Pair` object:
- `V`: the type of the value
- `K`: the type of the key

**This module should not use or know the type `Set`!!**



***Public Members***

- default constructor
- `Pair(const K& key, const V& value)`: copies the values referred to by the parameters into the instance variables
- `const V& value() const`: returns the **value** component of the pair
- `const K& key() const`: returns the **key** component of the pair
- `void display(std::ostream& os) const`: inserts into stream  `os` the key and the value of the pair in the following format
  ```
  KEY : VALUE<endl>
  ```


***Free Helper***

- `std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Pair<V, K>& pair)`: calls the member
 function `display()` on `pair` to insert a pair into stream `os`.


Add any other **private** members that your design requires (without changing the specs above)!





## Part 2 (100%)

The second part of this workshop upgrades your Part 1 solution to
- align the key and value output in pretty columnar format
- accumulate the values stored in a `Set` object, for a specified key, which serves as the filter for selecting elements from the `Set`

To implement each upgrade, you will derive templated classes from your original templated classes (one derived class from `Set` and one derived class from `Pair`) and specialize the class derived from `Pair` as described below.





### `Pair` Module

Modify the `display()` member function in the `Pair` module to enable inclusion polymorphism on the `Pair` hierarchy.

No other changes are necessary to this module.





### `PairSummable` Module

A new module called `PairSummable` represents a `Pair` that has key alignment, compatibility and summation functionality.

Derive the `PairSummable` class template from `Pair<V, K>`. Your template receives 2 template parameters:
- `V`: the type of the value
- `K`: the type of the key

**This module should not use or know the type `Set` or `SetSummable`!!**


***Static Private Members for `PairSummable`***

- an object of type `V` that holds the *initial value* for a summation. The initial value varies with the type of the value in the value-key pair.
- a variable of type `size_t` that holds the minimum field width for pretty columnar output of key-value  pairs (initialize it with 0). This is the minimum number of characters needed to display any key in a set of keys.

  This value must be updated every time a new pair is constructed.




***Public Members for `PairSummable`***

- default constructor

- `PairSummable(const K& key, const V& value = initial)`: calls the base class constructor passing the two parameters to it, and updates the field width if necessary. *ðŸ—Ž Explain in the reflection what `= initial` in the prototype means.*
  - This function assumes that the type `K` supports a function named `size()`, which returns the number of characters required to display `key`.  Use this function to determine if the field width must be updated.

- `bool isCompatibleWith(const PairSummable<V, K>& b) const`: returns *true* if the parameter has the same `key` as the current object, *false* otherwise.

- overload the `operator+=` to receive a reference to an unmodifiable `PairSummable` object. This function adds the `value` of the parameter object to the `value` of the current object and returns a reference to the current object.  Assume that the current object and the parameter have the same `key`.

- override the `display()` query to set the alignment to left and the field width to the value of the static attribute (see above, in the static members section) for all `K` types, then call the base class version of `display()`, and finally restore the alignment to right.



***Specializations***

- for `V = std::string` and `K = std::string`, the function `operator+=()` should concatenate the values stored using `", "` as a separator (use operator `+` to concatenate strings), for the result shown in the sample output.




### `Set` Module

The `Set` module doesn't require any change.




### `SetSummable` Module

A new module called `SetSummable` represents a collection that is summable on a subset of the collection.

Derive the `SetSummable` class template from your `Set<N, T>` template. Your new template has 2 template parameters (in order):
- `N`: the capacity of the collection (an integer without sign)
- `T`: the type of any element in the collection

Your design assumes that the type `T`:
- has a constructor that accepts an `std::string` as a parameter, which specifies the filter for identifying the elements that belong to the subset.
- has a member function named `isCompatibleWith`, which returns *true* if the object is compatible with an object of type `T`; *false* otherwise.
- supports the `operator+=` operation, which adds an object of type `T` to another object of type `T`.


**This module should not use or know the type `Pair` or `PairSummable`!!**



***Public Member for `SetSummable`***

- `T accumulate(const std::string& filter) const`: this query accumulates into a local object of type `T` the subset of all the elements in the collection that satisfy `filter`.

  - define a local `T` object that satisfies `filter`, using the one-argument constructor. This object will serve as the accumulator.

  - iterate over the collection and add to your accumulator only those elements that are compatible with the local object.
     - check each element in the collection to determine if it is compatible with your accumulator object (use the `this->get()` member function to access the element)
     - if compatible, add the element to your accumulator object
  - return a copy of your accumulator object to the client.


In our **very specific instantiation**, `SetSummable` will manage a collection of `PairSummable` objects; two objects of type `PairSummable` are considered compatible if the have the same key.  The design above is more general, and allows `SetSummable` to work with other types that are not `PairSummable` as long as they support the mentioned operations.
